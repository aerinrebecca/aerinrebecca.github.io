<h3>SAW's Story</h3>
<p>The founders of SAW met when they were college. They all grew up hearing the horrors of climate change and global warming but saw no one changing their harmful ways. As a result, they took matters into their own hands and decided to do something about it. Since they all bonded over their passion for engineering, they decided to start SAW and make all electric cars.
